Scope of Project

The scope of our project encompasses the development of a Real-Time News Aggregator and Insights Platform tailored for news in Hong Kong. The primary goal of the platform is to provide users with timely and relevant information about news events happening in the region.

The key components of the project scope include:
1. Data Collection: We will establish a robust system to collect news articles from various sources, including online news portals, social media platforms, and other credible sources. The data collection process will ensure a comprehensive coverage of news in Hong Kong.

2. News Classification and Summarization: We will leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for news analysis, including tasks such as classification, summarization, sentiment analysis and word cloud. These techniques will enable us to process and analysis the collected news articles effectively. Additionally, we will use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise summaries that capture the essential information from each article, facilitating a quick understanding of the main points.

3. Multimodality Model for News Classification and Summarization (Optional): As an optional task within the project scope, we will explore capability of the implementing multimodality model to handle both textual and image data. This advanced model will enhance news classification and enable more efficient summarization by considering both textual and visual information. However, the successful implementation of this task is subject to factors such as time, technical feasibility, and resource availability. It is important to note that the inclusion of the multimodality model as an optional task is subject to evaluation and feasibility. The decision to proceed with this task will be based on project progress, availability of open-source model and computational resources.

4. Dashboard and User Interface: The platform will feature an intuitive and user-friendly platform that displays the analysed news data, categorized articles and summaries. The dashboard will provide customizable filters and search functionalities to allow users to access the information they need efficiently. To enhance user experiences, we will include personalization features that allow users perform filtering on dashboard results.
