Existing Method

The existing popular news aggregators in Hong Kong include local news websites and international news platforms.

Local news websites, such as HK01 and InMediaHK, typically employ journalists and reporters who gather news from various sources, conduct interviews, and produce original news articles. However, there can be limitations in terms of objectivity, as the content may be influenced by the journalists' perspectives or the media's positions. Additionally, there may be an overemphasis on popular or trending content to attract more views, which could affect the overall balance and diversity of news coverage.

On the other hand, international news platforms like Google News and Yahoo News aggregate news from different publishers and present them in a single interface. While they offer a wide range of news sources, they often lack localization and may not provide sufficient coverage of local news in Hong Kong. This limitation can result in a reduced understanding of the specific context and issues that are relevant to the local audience.

Furthermore, both local news websites and international news platforms may lack contextual understanding and advanced NLP techniques for news analysis. This means that the platforms may struggle to fully grasp the deeper meaning and implications of news content. They may not be able to effectively analyze and reflected the sentiment and response expressed by the society towards the news event.

These limitations highlight the need for improvements in news aggregation methods, including the incorporation of advanced NLP techniques to enhance contextual understanding, sentiment analysis, and summarization. Localization efforts, ensuring a more balanced and diverse coverage of news, and fostering transparency and objectivity in news reporting are also important areas that can be addressed to enhance the existing methods of news aggregation in Hong Kong.
