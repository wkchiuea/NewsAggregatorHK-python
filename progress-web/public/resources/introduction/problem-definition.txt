Problem Definition and Impact

The problem we aim to address is the limited availability of comprehensive platforms in Hong Kong that effectively aggregate, analyse, and present news events in a timely and organized manner. Despite the presence of various news sources, such as online portals and social media platforms, the fragmentation of these sources poses challenges for individuals, businesses, and organizations in staying informed and making well-informed decisions based on the most recent information available.

Our proposed solution is to develop a unified platform that collects and aggregates news and comments while utilizing NLP algorithms for analysis and summarization, specifically catering to the Hong Kong audience in the local language. This approach not only streamlines access by saving time for users who would otherwise visit multiple news websites but also enhances efficiency by presenting a digest of diverse news sources. By offering a panoramic view of news content from different political perspectives, the platform empowers readers to understand various narratives and form a well-rounded opinion. Additionally, it serves as a vital tool for businesses, governments, and organizations to gauge public reaction and sentiment on a broad scale. This real-time pulse-checking feature adds immense value for decision-makers and analysts who aim to stay informed about the public's stance on various issues. Overall, the platform acts as a comprehensive resource for anyone seeking to tap into the landscape of news and public opinion quickly and effectively.
