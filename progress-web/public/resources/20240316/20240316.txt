Background and Motivation

In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, it is crucial for individuals, businesses, and organizations to stay well-informed. However, manually monitoring multiple news outlets and extracting insights from the vast amount of data could be a time-consuming task. Study showed that Hong Kong people are spending an average of 1.5 hours every day on reading different media content in 2023 [1]. While news aggregators are popular in other regions, they primarily focus on English news only, leaving a significant gap in the Hong Kong market for a comprehensive news aggregator and analysis platform in the local language.

The motivation behind this project stems from the increasing demand for timely, accurate, and centralized news analysis in the local language for the Hong Kong market. People currently spend significant time navigating different news websites and social media accounts to stay updated. However, this approach is not efficient in a fast-paced market like Hong Kong. While Hong Kong has some news aggregation services, such as Google News and Yahoo News, these offerings are relatively limited and do not provide deeper analytical tools like sentiment analysis or summarization that would enable users to better understand and interpret the news content. To address this challenge, there is a clear necessity for an automated solution that not only monitors and aggregates real-time news content but also delivers insightful analysis at the same time. The project incorporates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as sentiment analysis and summarization to assist the user in analysing the news content and understand the reaction from society. We aim to develop an all-in-one platform that streamline the readerâ€™s experience on both aggregate and analyse news content from online and social media news outlet accounts.
